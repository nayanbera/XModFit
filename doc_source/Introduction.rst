Introduction
============
    **XModFit** stands for **X**\-ray **Mod**\eling and **Fit**\ting. **XModFit** provides a graphical user interface (GUI) platform to quickly write fitting functions for any 1-dimensional data primarily focussed on X-ray scattering. The package is developed at `NSF's ChemMatCARS (Sector 15) <https://chemmatcars.uchicago.edu/>`_  at `Advanced Photon Source <https://www.aps.anl.gov/>`_ , USA.

    If you are using any components of **XModFit** for your research/work please do not forget to acknowledge (see :ref:`Acknowledgements`).
